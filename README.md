# Stingle Photos for Self Hosted Server

Starting with v2.10.2, the [Stingle Photos App](https://github.com/stingle/stingle-photos-android) supports custom server URLs, and works correctly with [c2FmZQ Server](https://c2FmZQ.org).

On the _Welcome screen_, click the settings button at the top right corner, and then enter your server's URL.

The forked version of v2.9.0 is still available in the [v2.9.0 branch](https://github.com/c2FmZQ/stingle-photos-for-self-hosted-server/tree/v2.9.0).
